‚úÖ Working Application & How to Run It
This is a Python-Streamlit-based Expense & Budget Tracker, designed as a complete solution. It allows users to plan, track, and analyze their expenses against monthly budgets in a clear, visual interface.

##üîß Setup Instructions
1. Clone or Download the Application Folder
Download or clone the folder containing streamlit_app.py, and the README.md file.
2. Install Python Requirements
Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
Use pip to install required libraries:
~ streamlit
~ pandas
These can be installed by typing this in the terminal: pip install streamlit pandas
3. Launch the Application
Navigate to the folder where streamlit_app.py is located.
Run the following command: streamlit run streamlit_app.py

The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

##üß™ Test Steps to Validate the Application
Open the application using streamlit run streamlit_app.py.
Go to Set Budget and set budget values for each category for the current month.
Navigate to Add Expense and log expenses under the same categories.
Go to Monthly Summary and verify:
Expense entries are listed.
Total spent and remaining budget are calculated correctly.
Use Plan Expense to enter a hypothetical amount and verify that toast feedback shows if it's feasible.
Use Split Expense to calculate fair share of a group expense.
In Budget Alerts, test if alerts show when expenses exceed or approach 90% of the budget.

##2Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Queries / ORM Abstraction
‚úÖ Covered in the code via sqlite3 statements:

CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, SELECT, DELETE, and GROUP BY are all SQL-based interactions.
Queries are cleanly abstracted in functions like:
~add_expense()
~set_budget()
~check_budget_alerts()
~get_monthly_summary()

##üí° Highlights
Beautiful UI with background image and branded title
Toast notifications for budget limits
Live table updates when saving budgets or logging expenses
All calculations are based on actual stored values in a local SQLite database
Fully modular and extendable Python code
